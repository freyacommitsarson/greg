<h1>CREECHUR</h1>
<hr>
<p>Hi, im creechur, i created this webpage as a brain dump for my art and other hobbies.</p>
<p>I traditionally do graphic design, tradition and digital art, and i do film projects, all of which will end up here.</p>
<p>Most of the things i do come from my interests, skateboarding, video games, and action movies.</p>
<p> Ill have a few pages linked from here that lead to different music i listen to. (pages i made so you dont have to deal with the youtube putting the wrong video)
</p>
<p> Finally, I am friends with a few content creators so ima link 1 video from each of them and you can find their channels if you like the content</p>

<p>this is plaguerat also very funny but has much more niche interests, very genuine and you should watch their voice over videos</p>
